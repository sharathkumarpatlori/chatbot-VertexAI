==== Description of Block 1 ====
That code snippet demonstrates a signal/slot connection using Qt's `QObject::connect()` function.
 Let's break it down:

* **`QSlider *slider = new QSlider(Qt::Horizontal);`**: This line creates a new horizontal slider widget (`QSlider`) and assigns its pointer to the `slider` variable.

* **`QSpinBox *spin = new QSpinBox;`**: This creates a new spin box widget (`QSpinBox`) and assigns its pointer to `spin`.

* **`QObject::connect(slider, &QSlider::valueChanged, spin, &QSpinBox::setValue);`**: This is the core of the signal/slot connection.
 It links the `valueChanged` signal of the `slider` to the `setValue` slot of the `spinbox`.
 Whenever the slider's value changes (the signal is emitted), the spin box's value will be updated to match (the slot is invoked).
 `&QSlider::valueChanged` and `&QSpinBox::setValue` are obtaining the addresses of these signals and slots respectively.
 This is a modern, safer way to connect signals and slots in Qt.

In short, this code creates a slider and a spin box, and links them so that moving the slider automatically updates the spin box's value.

==== Description of Block 2 ====
That code snippet shows how to connect a signal and a slot in Qt, a C++ framework.
Let's break it down:

* **`connect(const QObject * sender, const char * signal, const QObject * receiver, const char * slot)`:** This is the connection function.
 It links a signal emitted by one object (`sender`) to a slot (a function) in another object (`receiver`).
 `signal` and `slot` are strings specifying the names of the signal and slot respectively.
 This is the older, string-based connection method, common in Qt4 and earlier versions.
 It's less type-safe than newer methods.

* **`QSlider *slider = new QSlider(Qt::Horizontal);`:** This line creates a new horizontal slider widget.
`QSlider` is a Qt class, `Qt::Horizontal` specifies the slider's orientation, and `new` dynamically allocates memory for the slider object.
 The pointer `slider` holds the address of this newly created object.
 Remember to delete this using `delete slider;` when it's no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.

==== Start of Block 3 ====

==== Description of Block 3 ====
The line `QSpinBox *spin = new QSpinBox;` creates a new QSpinBox object dynamically on the heap and assigns its memory address to a pointer named `spin`.
 `QSpinBox` is a Qt widget for spin boxes (controls allowing integer input).
The `*` indicates `spin` is a pointer, not the object itself.

The lines `QObject::connect(...)` establish a connection between a slider (presumably a `QSlider` object) and the `spin` box.
 When the slider's `valueChanged(int)` signal is emitted (meaning the slider's value changes), the `spin` box's `setValue(int)` slot is called, updating the spin box to reflect the slider's new value.
 This is a common Qt mechanism for handling events and updating the UI.
 The compiler doesn't directly check the signal/slot names at compile time because they are handled through macros that resolve at runtime.
 If you change the signal or slot name, the connection will likely fail at runtime, not compile time.
 Using `PointerToMemberFunction` (not shown in your example but implied by your question) would offer compile-time checking, but it's not used in the provided code snippet.

==== Start of Block 4 ====

==== Description of Block 4 ====
The error you're encountering—compiler errors preventing application startup—is likely unrelated to the `#include <iostream>` line itself.
 That line simply includes the input/output stream library, necessary for standard input and output operations (like `std::cout` for printing to the console).
 The problem lies elsewhere in your code.

Your description points to a problem with function overloading and casting in Qt versions prior to 5.7.
 The `static_cast` and `::display` usage attempts to explicitly call a specific overloaded version of the `display` function (likely within `QLCDNumber`).
 However, before Qt 5.7 and C++11, the compiler couldn't reliably determine which overload to use based on the context.

Qt 5.7's solution using `QOverload<int>::of(&QLCDNumber::display)` provides a way to explicitly specify the desired overload (in this case, the one accepting an `int`).
 This resolves the ambiguity.
 The `<int>`, `<QString>`, or `<double>` templates within `QOverload` allow you to select the appropriate overload for different data types.
 The issue wasn't with the `#include`, but with the compiler's inability to handle the overloaded function without explicit specification in earlier Qt versions.
