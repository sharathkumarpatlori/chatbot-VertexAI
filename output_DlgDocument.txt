==== Description of Block 1 ====
This block of code is the constructor of the DlgDocument class.
It initializes the user interface (UI) of a dialog window for creating and editing documentation.
Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

1.
`#include` Statements:
   - These lines include necessary header files for the functionality of the dialog window.

2.
Class Definition:
   - `DlgDocument` is a custom dialog class that inherits from `QDialog`.

3.
Constructor:
   - The constructor `DlgDocument` takes an optional `QWidget* parent` parameter, which is the parent widget of the dialog.

4.
UI Setup:
   - `ui->setupUi(this);` sets up the user interface elements defined in the `.ui` file.

5.
Window Title:
   - `setWindowTitle(QCoreApplication::applicationName());` sets the title of the dialog window to the application name.

6.
Text Edit Widget:
   - A `QTextEdit` widget named `textEditRemark` is created and added to the dialog.
This widget will be used for editing the documentation text.

7.
Signal-Slot Connections:
   - Several signal-slot connections are established to handle events related to the text edit widget, such as font and text format changes.

8.
Font and Text Formatting:
   - Default font, font size, and color are set for the text edit widget.

9.
Context Menu:
   - A custom context menu is set up for the text edit widget to provide additional formatting options.

10.
Additional UI Elements:
    - Various UI elements like buttons, combo boxes, and a font color button are created and connected to their respective slots for handling formatting actions.

11.
Document Handling:
    - The constructor can optionally take an `IVDocument* document` parameter, which represents the document being edited.

12.
Layout:
    - The layout of the dialog window is set using a vertical layout.

13.
Property Settings:
    - The `openExternalLinks` property of the text edit widget is set to `true` to allow opening external links.

14.
Child Widgets:
    - The child widgets of the text edit widget are iterated over to find a specific widget named "QWidgetTextControl".

In summary, this code sets up a dialog window with a text edit widget for creating and editing documentation, including various UI elements and formatting options
==== End of Block 1 ====

==== Start of Block 2 ====

==== Description of Block 2 ====
This block of code appears to be part of a custom dialog window for creating and editing documentation.
Here's a brief explanation of what it does:

1.
It iterates over the child widgets of a `QWidgetTextControl` object, which is likely a custom widget used for text editing.

2.
For each child widget, it retrieves the property name and value using Qt's meta-object system.

3.
It sets the `openExternalLinks` property to `true` for the child widget, allowing external links to be opened when clicked.

4.
It enables mouse tracking for the child widget.

5.
It sets up a custom context menu for the text edit widget, allowing users to access additional formatting options.

6.
It stores the default text character format for later use.

In summary, this code enhances the text editing capabilities of the dialog window by enabling external link opening, mouse tracking, and a custom context menu.
