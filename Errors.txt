chat-bison@001 test function:

"""int main() {
            std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::end;
            }"""

Response: This line defines the main function, which is the entry point for all C++ programs. The function takes no arguments and returns an integer value. The body of the function consists of a single statement that prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.
