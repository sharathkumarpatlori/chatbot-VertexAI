==== Description of Block 1 ====
The code snippet you provided is a data class declaration in Kotlin.
Data classes are a concise way to define classes that hold data, and they provide several benefits such as automatic generation of getters, setters, and a `toString()` method.

In this specific case, the `LoggedInUser` data class has two properties: `userId` and `displayName`.
These properties are used to store information about a logged-in user, such as their unique identifier and their display name.

The data class is annotated with the `@JvmInline` annotation, which indicates that the class should be compiled into a single JVM instruction.
This can improve performance in some cases, particularly when the data class is used as a function parameter or return value.

Overall, this code snippet is a simple example of how to use data classes in Kotlin to represent and store data in a structured way.
