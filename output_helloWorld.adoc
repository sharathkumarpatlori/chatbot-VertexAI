==== Description of Block 1 ====
The line `#include <iostream>` includes the iostream standard library.
 This library provides input/output functionalities,  making it possible to use things like `std::cout` (for printing to the console) and `std::endl` (for inserting a newline character).

`int main() { ...
}` is the main function where program execution begins.
 The code within the curly braces `{}` will be executed.

`std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;` prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.
 `std::cout` is the standard output stream, `<<` is the insertion operator sending data to the stream, and `std::endl` adds a newline, moving the cursor to the next line.

`return 0;` indicates that the program executed successfully.
 A non-zero return value usually signifies an error.
