==== Start of Block 2 ====
==== Description of Block 2 ====This block of code is the main function of the program, enclosed in curly braces.
It declares several integer variables: userInput, maxNumber, minNumber, sumTotal, and a float variable average.
It uses a for loop to get three numbers from the user using scanf and prints them using std::cout.
Inside the loop, it updates the maxNumber and minNumber variables to keep track of the maximum and minimum numbers entered by the user.
It also calculates the sum of the numbers in the sumTotal variable.
After the loop, it prints the maximum, minimum, sum, and average of the three numbers.
Finally, it returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
