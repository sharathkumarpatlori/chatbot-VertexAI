==== Start of Block 2 (Lines 89-177) ====

==== Description of Block 2 ====
The function `send_chat` processes a source code file and generates documentation for it.
 It reads the file, splits the code into smaller blocks, and uses a large language model (`GenerativeModel`) to generate descriptions for each block.
 The descriptions are then written to an output file, with each block's documentation clearly separated.
Error handling is included to manage file not found errors and other exceptions during processing.
 The model uses parameters to control the randomness and length of the generated descriptions.
 A context and examples are provided to guide the language model's response.
