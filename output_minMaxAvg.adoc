==== Start of Block 1 (Lines 1-8) ====

==== Description of Block 1 ====
That code snippet sets up a C++ program to get user input and find the maximum and minimum numbers within a set of inputs.
Let's break it down line by line:

* `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the iostream library, which provides input/output functionalities in C++, allowing you to use `std::cout` (for printing to the console) and potentially `std::cin` (for reading from the console).

* `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the stdio.h library, which is a C library providing standard input/output functions.
 While functional,  `iostream` is generally preferred in C++ for better type safety and integration with the C++ standard.

* `int main()`: This is the main function where the program execution begins.

* `int userInput = 0;`: This declares an integer variable named `userInput` and initializes it to 0.
 This variable will store the numbers entered by the user.

* `int maxNumber = 0;`: Declares an integer variable `maxNumber` and initializes it to 0.
This will store the largest number entered.

* `int minNumber = 100;`: Declares an integer variable `minNumber` and initializes it to 100.
This will store the smallest number entered.
 The initial value of 100 assumes the user will input numbers less than or equal to 100.
 If you expect larger numbers, you should choose a different initial value for `minNumber`.

==== Start of Block 2 (Lines 9-16) ====

==== Description of Block 2 ====
This code snippet initializes two variables, `sumTotal` (an integer) and `average` (a float), both to 0.
 It then uses a `for` loop to prompt the user to enter three numbers using `std::cout`.
 The entered numbers are read using `scanf("%d", &userInput)`,  stored in a variable `userInput` (not shown in the provided snippet, but assumed to be an integer), and presumably added to `sumTotal` (this addition is not shown in the provided code).
 The loop iterates three times.
 The code is incomplete as it doesn't show how the `average` is calculated or the `userInput` variable is declared and used within the loop.
==== End of Block 2 ====

==== Start of Block 3 (Lines 17-24) ====

==== Description of Block 3 ====
The line `std::cout << userInput << "\n";` sends the value of the variable `userInput` to the standard output stream (usually your console) followed by a newline character (`\n`), which moves the cursor to the next line.
 It's a way to display the content of `userInput` on the screen.

The `if(userInput > maxNumber)` block checks if the current `userInput` is greater than the current `maxNumber`.
If it is, it updates `maxNumber` to store the new larger value.
 This keeps track of the largest number entered so far.

Similarly, the `if(userInput < minNumber)` block checks if `userInput` is smaller than the current `minNumber`.
If true, it updates `minNumber` to store this new smaller value, thus tracking the smallest number entered.
==== End of Block 3 ====

==== Start of Block 4 (Lines 25-32) ====

==== Description of Block 4 ====
That code snippet is part of a larger program that calculates the maximum, minimum, sum, and average of three user inputs.

- `minNumber = userInput;` This line assigns the value stored in the `userInput` variable to the `minNumber` variable.
 This happens inside a conditional block (not shown), implying it only occurs if `userInput` is smaller than the current value of `minNumber`.

- `sumTotal += userInput;` This line adds the value of `userInput` to the current value of `sumTotal`.
 The `+=` operator is a shorthand for `sumTotal = sumTotal + userInput;`.
 This accumulates the sum of all user inputs.
==== End of Block 4 ====

==== Start of Block 5 (Lines 33-35) ====

==== Description of Block 5 ====
That line of code prints the calculated average to the console.

Let's break it down:

* `std::cout`: This is the standard output stream in C++.
 It's where data is sent to be displayed on the screen.

* `<<`: This is the insertion operator.
It sends the data on its right to the output stream on its left.

* `"Average = "`: This is a string literal.
It's the text "Average = " that will be printed first.

* `average`: This is a variable (presumably holding a numerical value representing the average).
 Its value will be printed after "Average = ".

* `\n`: This is a newline character.
It moves the cursor to the next line after printing the average, so subsequent output will appear on a new line.

* `return 0;`: This line is not part of the printing statement.
It's the return statement of the `main` function, indicating successful program execution.
