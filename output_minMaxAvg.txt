==== Start of Block 1 ====

==== Description of Block 1 ====
`#include <iostream>` includes the iostream standard library, providing input/output functionalities like printing to the console (using `cout`) and reading from the console (using `cin`).

`#include <stdio.h>` includes the stdio.h standard library,  providing older C-style input/output functions like `printf` and `scanf`.
 While functional, `iostream` is generally preferred in C++ for its object-oriented approach.

`int main() { ...
}` This is the main function where program execution begins.
 The code within the curly braces `{}` will be executed.

`int userInput = 0;` declares an integer variable named `userInput` and initializes it to 0.
 This variable will likely store user input.

`int maxNumber = 0;` declares an integer variable named `maxNumber` and initializes it to 0.
This will likely store the maximum number encountered.

`int minNumber = 100;` declares an integer variable named `minNumber` and initializes it to 100.
This will likely store the minimum number encountered.
==== End of Block 1 ====

==== Start of Block 2 ====

==== Description of Block 2 ====
The line `int sumTotal = 0;` declares an integer variable named `sumTotal` and initializes it to 0.
 This variable will store the sum of numbers entered by the user.

The line `float average = 0;` declares a floating-point variable named `average` and initializes it to 0.
This variable will store the average of the numbers.

The `for` loop iterates three times (i = 0, 1, 2).
Inside the loop:

* `std::cout << "Enter a number: ";` displays a prompt asking the user to enter a number.
* `scanf("%d", &userInput);` reads an integer value entered by the user and stores it in the variable `userInput` (Note:  `userInput` needs to be declared as an integer variable (`int userInput;`) before the loop).
 The `%d` format specifier indicates that an integer is expected.
 The `&` before `userInput` provides the memory address where the input should be stored.
==== End of Block 2 ====

==== Start of Block 3 ====

==== Description of Block 3 ====
`std::cout << userInput << "\n";` This line sends the value stored in the `userInput` variable to the standard output stream (usually your console).
 `<<` is the insertion operator, adding data to the stream.
`"\n"` adds a newline character, moving the cursor to the next line after printing.
 `std::` indicates that `cout` belongs to the standard namespace.

`if(userInput > maxNumber)` This line checks if the value in `userInput` is greater than the value in `maxNumber`.
If true, the code within the following curly braces `{}` is executed.

`{//the biggest number entered so far is the max number maxNumber = userInput;}` This block updates `maxNumber` to the value of `userInput`, making `maxNumber` hold the largest number encountered so far.

`if(userInput < minNumber)` This line checks if the value in `userInput` is less than the value in `minNumber`.
If true, the code within the following curly braces `{}` is executed.

`{//the lowest number entered so far is the min number ...
}`  This block (the content of which is not provided) would similarly update `minNumber` to hold the smallest number encountered so far.
==== End of Block 3 ====

==== Start of Block 4 ====

==== Description of Block 4 ====
That code snippet is part of a loop that calculates the maximum, minimum, sum, and average of three user inputs.

* `minNumber = userInput;`: This line assigns the value stored in the `userInput` variable to the `minNumber` variable.
 This happens only if the current `userInput` is smaller than the current `minNumber`.
 It's used to keep track of the smallest number entered so far.

* `sumTotal += userInput;`: This line adds the value of `userInput` to the current value of `sumTotal`.
 It's a shorthand way of writing `sumTotal = sumTotal + userInput;`.
This accumulates the sum of all user inputs.

The lines using `std::cout` simply print the calculated maximum, minimum, sum, and average to the console.
 `average = sumTotal / 3.0;` calculates the average by dividing the `sumTotal` by 3.0 (using 3.0 ensures floating-point division for a more accurate result).
==== End of Block 4 ====

==== Start of Block 5 ====

==== Description of Block 5 ====
This line prints the calculated average to the console.
Let's break it down:

* `std::cout`: This is the standard output stream object in C++, used to send data to the console (your screen).
 `std::` indicates it's part of the standard namespace.

* `<<`: This is the insertion operator.
It inserts the following data into the output stream.
 It's used multiple times to chain together different things to be printed.

* `"Average = "`: This is a string literal.
It prints the text "Average = " to the console.

* `average`: This is a variable (presumably you've calculated an average value earlier in your code).
Its value is inserted into the output stream.

* `\n`: This is a newline character.
It moves the cursor to the next line after printing the average, so subsequent output will appear on a new line.

`return 0;` This line signifies the successful completion of the program's `main` function.
 A return value of 0 typically indicates that the program executed without errors.
