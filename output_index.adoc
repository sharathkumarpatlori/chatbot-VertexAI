==== Description of Block 1 ====
This code snippet registers a React Native application.

Let's break it down:

- `import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';`: This line imports the `AppRegistry` component, which is essential for running React Native apps.
 It's part of the React Native core library.

- `import App from './App';`: This imports the main application component, `App`, from a file named `App.js` (or `App.jsx`) located in the same directory.

- `import {name as appName} from './app.json';`: This imports the `name` property from the `app.json` file and assigns it to the variable `appName`.
 `app.json` contains metadata about your app.

- `AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);`: This is the core registration.
 It tells the React Native system that an app component exists.
 `appName` (from `app.json`) is the name used to identify the app, and `() => App` is a function that returns the main app component (`App`).
 This function is called when the app starts.
